				<h1>Problem &amp; Challenge</h1>
				<h2>Diversity in STEAM</h2>
				<p>Skills and interest in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) subjects are urgently needed for tomorrow’s workforce -- yet women and other minorities are significantly underrepresented in STEAM fields.  Black and Hispanic professionals, for instance, represent only 9% and 7% of STEAM workforce, respectively (Pew, 2018).  Even worse, women and minorities appear to lose interest in STEAM subjects as they reach adolescence; for instance, less than 30% of science and technology researchers are women (UNESCO), while the percentage of women who graduate with a computer science degree dropped from 37% in 1985 to 14% nationwide (ComputerScience.org, 2019). The problem calls for innovative and research-based EdTech solution.</p>
				<p>There is a need to design technology-based solutions that are culturally sensitive, debunking stereotypes and myths that women and minorities do not like STEAM. Further, research has shown that play and culturally relevant pedagogy can be effective in promoting interest, learning, and new identities in STEAM fields.</p>
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>TC EdTech INA 2019 calls for proposal to solve the problem of lack of diversity in STEAM fields, by designing innovative Educational Technology integrating culturally relevant play pedagogy.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Culturally Relevant Play Pedagogy</em><br>Play is the oldest form of learning and has benefits for all types of learning and learners. We believe play can be used as an effective framework to support all learners enter and thrive in STEAM fields. However, play has not been sufficiently and effectively integrated to support learning in consideration of different ways people play and learn.</li>
					<li><em>Innovative Educational Technology</em><br>Innovation is defined as a research-based creative solution to address an authentic problem.</li>

				<h1>THE AWARD</h1>
				<h2>What is the Innovation Award?</h2>
				<p>TC EdTech INA's mission is to provide a pathway to innovative, research-based EdTech, bridging the gap between practice and research in the EdTech field. The 2019 TC EdTech INA calls on students to solve the problem of lack of diversity in STEAM fields through the design of an EdTech solution, backed by research, and fueled by innovative, culturally relevant play pedagogy.</p>

				<h2>How does this work?</h2>
				<p>The Innovation Award is actually more than a single event. This year we will host the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Two-day Hackathon</strong> &mdash; March 29 - 30, Friday - Saturday</li>
					<li><strong>Award and Project Showcase</strong> &mdash; April 13, Saturday</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The hackathon is a two day intensive program for teams with high-potential talent and ideas. This program is selective and designed to guide teams through the process of refining concepts and product prototypes.</p>
				<p>In this program your team will:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Learn how to design, develop, and test your ideas</li>
					<li>Work with experienced researchers and mentors to critically examine your process and work</li>
					<li>Learn new skills through interdisciplinary collaboration</li>
					<li>Create a substantive body of work as a stage for future opportunities</li>
				</ul>
				<p>At the end of the program, final product prototypes will be judged by a panel of experts in a culminating competition and showcase event.</p>

				<h1>INNOVATION</h1>

				<h2>What is innovation in Educational Technology (EdTech)?</h2>
				<p><em>Innovation</em> is broadly defined as an original idea, product, method, process, or model that can make a positive impact. The <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/tcedtech" target="_blank">TC EdTech</a> Initiative understands that education and technology innovation comes in many forms. The following table demonstrates the possible range of submissions:</p>

				<table class="table table-striped">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Types</th>
							<th>Examples</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Formats</td>
							<td>Digital, Non-digital, Hybrid</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Technologies</td>
							<td>Web-apps, games and toys, virtual reality, software, hardware, etc.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Products</td>
							<td>Physical artifacts, designed experiences, models and processes, etc.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Perspectives</td>
							<td>Cognitive, classroom culture, research, data analytics, social justice, etc.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Audiences</td>
							<td>K-12, Higher Ed, Distance, Teachers, Parents, Administrators etc.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<p>This list above is far from exhaustive, but the takeaway is that students from <em>all</em> subject matters and different technology and technical expertise are encouraged to participate.</p>

				<h2>Open to all Columbia University students.</h2>
				<p>Innovation in EdTech is interdisciplinary and collaborative by nature. It takes <em>both technology and domain</em> expertise to do it with <em>depth</em>, and to do it <em>right</em>. As such, the Innovation Award is open to all Columbia University students. Opportunities will be provided to help you find the right team.<br><br>See <a href="./students.html">Students</a> for details.</p>

				<h2>How are teams and ideas evaluated?</h2>
					<p>Problems and projects will be wide-ranging. The following are five areas that will be considered.</p>
					<table class="table table-striped">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Category</th>
								<th>Description</th>

					</table>
					<p>These categories are not intended to be a definitive measure. Rather, they will be used as a guide to allow fairness and equity in the proceedings.</p>
					<p>Projects will be evaluated by a panel of judges comprised of a range of disciplines and perspectives (e.g. TC and Columbia faculty members, Edtech entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, teachers, school administrators, members of the student senate.)</p>

				<h1>TC and EdTech</h1>

				<h2>There's a problem with EdTech...</h2>
				<p>In a recent Education Week article, Susan Fuhrman described how educational technology startups and companies are worryingly disconnected from researchers and academics (Fuhrman, 2017).</p>
				<p>Millions of dollars are spent on educational technology products that are ineffective and unproven. These products are often designed without collaboration with researchers and are not aligned with current learning sciences research.</p>

				<h2>What can we do?</h2>
				<p>Through the collaborative efforts of the <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/tcedtech" target="_blank">TC EdTech</a> Initiative and the <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/mathematics-science-and-technology/communication-media-and-learning-technologies-design/" target="_blank">Communication, Media, Learning Technologies Design Program (CMLTD)</a>, the 2019 Innovation Award is one of TC’s first public steps forward in addressing this issue.</p>
				<p>Our approach:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Connect creators to researchers</li>
					<li>Build interdisciplinary capacity</li>
					<li>Bridge industry to academia</li>
				</ol>
				<p>By connecting students from different disciplines and research within the TC community, and bridging the gaps between institution and industry, it’s our goal to inspire <em>innovation</em> in the field of applied learning.</p>

				<h2>TC’s commitment to the future of EdTech</h2>
				<p>TC is committed to the future of educational technology with a special emphasis on sound practices grounded in research. We are proud to be hosting this event and delighted by the traction that has been building behind the spirit.</p>
